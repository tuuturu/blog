## Mind blowing realizations

- Wet stuff is slippery (WHAT!?)
- Good boots are important, your foot can get caught beneath 200kilos of bike (surprised pikachu face)
- 200kg is heavy (physics never seize to baffle me)

## Intro

My girlfriend surprised me one day with an invitation to go mushroom picking.
Now, I have to admit, I'm not particularly fond of mushrooms, and at that
moment, the allure of staying in and being lazy was strong. However, a spark of
inspiration ignited in me – what if I could turn this into a two-wheeled
adventure?

## An Unconventional Plan

I proposed my idea to her: I'd accompany her on my motorcycle while she went
about her mushroom-picking expedition. It seemed like the perfect compromise.
As she focused on gathering mushrooms, I could explore the surroundings on my
bike. She agreed, and we set off on an unusual outdoor excursion.

## Off the Beaten Path

My motorcycle became my trusty steed for this impromptu escapade. I took every
opportunity to ride it wherever the trail allowed. One path led me down a
tractor road that seemingly led to nowhere. Despite the road's dead-end fate, I
decided to venture on. The journey was challenging, as I maneuvered the bike
along the uneven terrain.

## A Slippery Twist

On my way back, I noticed my girlfriend had veered off the trail to search for
mushrooms. I saw this as an opportunity to follow her, despite the obstacles in
my path. Wet branches blocked my way, and I tried to navigate through them with
utmost care. However, the rain-soaked branches proved to be more slippery than
I anticipated. In an instant, my bike skidded out from beneath me, and I found
myself on the ground.

## Bike's Rest Stop

Remember the saying that all bikes need a rest sometimes? Well, this time it
was true. My motorcycle seemed to decide that the moment called for a brief
pause. Thankfully, the mishap resulted in only a few scratches on the bike,
with no significant damage. My foot almost got caught, but luckily, no real harm
done. Mental note: invest in sturdier boots for future rides.

## Strength and Support

This wasn't my first encounter with dropping a bike – my MT-09 had experienced
a similar fate before. Surprisingly, lifting the Yamaha Tenere 700 proved to be
a bit more challenging. Whether it was the angle, the weight distribution, or
simply the absence of adrenaline, the task was daunting. Fortunately, my
girlfriend arrived just in time to lend a hand and rescue me from my
predicament.

## The Verdict: A Memorable Experience

In retrospect, it was a day of both unexpected adventure and valuable lessons.
Exploring the woods on my motorcycle while my girlfriend hunted for mushrooms
added a unique twist to our outdoor plans. The Yamaha
Tenere 700 had a "rest stop," and I had a reality check – lifting a bike isn't
always as easy as it seems.

## Conclusion: Moments that Define the Journey

As I reflect on this escapade, I'm reminded that these experiences are
precisely what I invested in the motorcycle for. The joy of exploration, the
thrill of the unexpected, and the camaraderie of sharing the story – all these
moments define the journey on two wheels. So, despite a minor stumble, I
emerged from the woods with a story worth telling and memories that added a
little extra character to my motorcycling adventures.
