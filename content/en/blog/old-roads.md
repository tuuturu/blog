Have you ever had a friend who could turn any ordinary day into an
extraordinary adventure? Well, I have a friend like that - Kim. One day, out of
the blue, he sent me a text message that would set the wheels in motion for a
memorable motorcycle trip. The conversation went something like this:

**Kim**: "hello?"

**Julius**: "Jesus f****** christ. Didn't know you were there", pretending like he caught me off guard

**Kim**: "motorcycle?"

**Julius**: "It's already fired up"

With minimal planning required, we set our sights on
the old road to Vivestad. It turned out to be a beautiful, albeit overgrown and
slippery, route perfect for motorcycle exploration. As we revved up our engines
and hit the road, little did we know what awaited us. The ascent was
challenging, with the wet and slippery conditions testing our riding skills.
But the reward at the top was worth it - a stunning view that took
our breath away. As we began our descent, there was a moment of panic when Kim
forgot to properly put the sidestand down and the bike toppled over. I couldn't
help but tease him, saying, "You're not getting points for that one!" You see,
we have an informal competition to see who can accumulate the most drops by the
end of the season. With the score still tied at 2-2, it was clear that our
adventure was just getting started.

**Exploring Uncharted Roads**

Eager to continue our exploration, we decided to
revisit a road we had discovered on a previous ride. This time, we were on the
lookout for new paths and hidden gems. Our first discovery was a narrow road
that ran alongside towering power masts. As we ventured further, the road
transformed into a small trail, tempting us to keep going. However, with time
running short, we made the tough decision to search for another road. Little
did we know that our next find would exceed all expectations.

**A Road Less Traveled**

We stumbled upon a recently built road used for lumber
transport. Intrigued by the unknown, we couldn't resist the temptation to see
where it would lead us. To our delight, the road took us through a dense
forest, revealing glimpses of nature's beauty. As we rode on, we
reached a charming cabin tucked away in the wilderness. But we weren't done
yet. The road continued, ascending over a mountain, promising even more
adventure. At the peak, we reluctantly admitted that time was against us, but
not before noting down the coordinates for our return. Turning our bikes around
on the muddy path proved to be a comical challenge, but we managed to conquer
it with laughter and determination. The journey back down was just as
thrilling, with the muddy terrain adding an extra touch of excitement to our
ride.

**Conclusion**

Our spontaneous motorcycle adventure had taken us on a
roller coaster of emotions, from the exhilarating climbs and heart-stopping
descents to the unexpected tumbles and the joy of discovery. As I reflect on
our journey, I can't help but feel grateful for the roads we traveled, the
memories we created, and the bond that grew stronger between Kim and me. We may
not have planned every detail, but that's the beauty of adventure - sometimes
the best experiences come from embracing the unknown. So, the next time an
unexpected opportunity presents itself, I encourage you to seize it, pack your
bags (or hop on your bike), and set off on your own spontaneous adventure. Who
knows what incredible roads and experiences await you?

Kim initiated the trip with a text message. The conversation went something like this:
Kim: "hello?"
Julius: "Jesus fucking christ. Didn't know you were there", pretending like he caught me off guard
Kim: "motorcycle?"
Julius: "It's already fired up"

We had a road in mind, The old road to Vivestad, so little planning was required. The road was beautiful. Mostly
overgrown, wet and slippery, but somehow the ideal road for bike exploration. After reaching the top we got a beautiful
view. The way down was mostly sliding in panic, but went well. Funny thing happened; Kim forgot to properly put the
sidestand down, so the bike went straight to the ground. I reacted by saying "you're not getting points for that one!".
We have a informal competition to have the most drops by the end of the season. The score is for now 2-2. The road
ended up in the back of a farm, which didn't feel right, but it was what it was.

During a previous ride, we found a neat road not far away, so I suggested we'd give it another go while looking for
other roads. First we found a neat road that went beside some power masts, and narrowed down into a small trail. We
decided to look for another one since the road got so narrow that it would take a lot of time to get to the end and we
were running out of time. The next road was a recently built road for lumber transport. Sheesh. What a great road. It
took us through the forest to a cabin, and further on over a mountain. At the top we decided we had ran out of time,
noted the coordinates and headed back down. Turning around was a bit goofy, but we managed. The road was very muddy
which made it a bit challenging, but damn. Great fun and what a great road. Can't wait to be back.
