As an avid motorcycle enthusiast, I've had the privilege of riding through
various landscapes, each offering its unique charm. Here's a glimpse of my
journey through eight countries, each experienced from the perspective of my
trusty MT09 and T7.

## Belgium: An Urban Ride (MT09)

My ride through Belgium felt like a continuous drive through a bustling city.
Perhaps I missed a turn somewhere but it was quite the urban experience.

## Denmark: A Flat Adventure (MT09)

Denmark, possibly the flattest country on earth, offered a unique riding
experience. The only way to get any kind of turns here is to play with left and right
turns through roundabouts. Thankfully, the 130 km/h speed limit on highways
makes the journey swift.

## England: A Beautiful Challenge (MT09)

England was a beautiful adventure with its stunning landscapes and twisty
routes. The national parks are a must-visit but remember to refuel before
entering as gas stations are sparse. Beware of speed traps and keep your bike
secure.

## France: A Quick Detour (MT09)

My experience in France was brief, only passing through from Belgium to Calais
for the ferry to England. Remember to stay hydrated if you're waiting for the
ferry, it can get hot!

## Germany: A Pleasant Ride (MT09)

Germany offered a diverse riding experience with its farmlands, autobahns, and
old brick cities. The helmet-friendly gas stations were a delightful surprise.
Be mindful of your exhaust noise here, but overall, Germany is a pleasure to
ride through.

## Netherlands: A Scenic Route (MT09)

Though I don't recall much about the roads, the views in the Netherlands were
memorable, as was the architecture and gardening.

## Norway: A Stunning Journey (MT09, T7)

Breathtaking views, high road standards, and twisty paths make Norway a great
ride. Be mindful of the strict nature preservation laws when going off-road.
Camping is allowed anywhere as long as it's 150 meters away from the nearest
house.

## Sweden: A Forest Adventure (MT09)

Sweden offered plenty of twisties and fun forest roads, making for an enjoyable
ride, although it lacked the mountain roads of its neighboring Norway.

## Introduction

I thought I'd do a write up about the countries I've been to.

Depending on what bike I was riding at the time, I had different focuses. For example, when I was riding my MT09 I'd
mostly be chasing twisties. When I was riding my T7, I'd be chasing gravel roads, off-road, vistas and
nature.

## Belgium

### Point of view: MT09

Don't know where I went wrong on this one, but my whole ride through Belgium felt like driving through a single city.

## Denmark

### Point of view: MT09

Boring. To get any kind of swing radius, you'll have to alternate between going left and right through roundabouts.
Denmark might just be the flattest country on earth. No data to back that up, but sheesh. At least the speed limit on
highways is 130 km/h, so you can get from A to B relatively quickly.

## England

### Point of view: MT09

England is pretty awesome. Beautiful landscape, and a lot of twisties. The national parks are a must visit. Remember to
fill up your tank before entering the national parks, as there's often no gas stations within the parks. And be careful,
cops are focusing on catching speeders there, and judging from the signs, a lot of bikers get hurt or die there.

When I got near to the border of Scotland, a random person at a gas station told me to be careful with my bike as it is
a popular type of bike to steal in these parts. In Hull I experienced the typical two guys on a scooter curious about
my bike situation. I did not feel comfortable there.

It's also the scariest place I've ridden in traffic. Roads are narrow. A lot of blind corners. And people are driving
fast.

## France

### Point of view: MT09

I'm probably exaggerating when including France since I've only driven from Belgium to Calais for the ferry over to
England, but I'll include it anyway. Can't remember much about the roads there, but do remember to bring enough water
when waiting for the ferry. It's damn warm there. Also, the ferry is expensive.

## Germany

### Point of view: MT09

A lot of farm land. Autobahn. The gas stations gives you a kleenex for wiping your helmet <3. I heard that they are
pretty strict on exhaust noise, but I haven't experienced any problems. Germany is pretty nice to drive through. A lot
of different roads. Old brick cities. Old farm roads. And at anytime, if you are tired and need to get somewhere fast,
the autobahn will take care of you.

## Netherlands

### Point of view: MT09

Can't remember much about the roads, but I do remember the views was good. Also, I love the architecture of the houses
and the gardening there.

## Norway

### Point of view: MT09

Great views, great road standards, not so high speed limits and pretty dramatic consequences for breaking the law.
However, due to mountains and uneven elevation, roads are often twisty and fun to ride even at lower (80km/h) speeds.

### Point of view: T7

Due to strict laws for preserving nature (beauty, sound and fauna), it's often frowned upon to drive off the road. This
makes it hard to find good roads, and you can rarely travel from A to B without going on the main roads. However,
there's a lot of forests and therefore logging roads. Not always open for the public, but often available. Remember,
try to minimize your footprint when visiting nature. A positive is that you can camp anywhere you want, as long as you
are 150 meters away from the nearest house.

## Sweden

Point of view: MT09

Less mountain roads, but still a lot of twisties and fun forest roads.
