# **Chasing the Hammock Dreams: A Cold Night's Adventure**

A sudden urge overcame me – the need to escape to nature and slumber beneath
the stars in my trusty hammock. These cravings for outdoor solitude strike
every now and then, and this time, I had a particular place in mind: a serene
lake known as [Mykle](https://goo.gl/maps/p3u6Kseg8ZGFKXKG8). My hope was to
discover uncharted gravel roads and bask in the thrill of the unknown. I
reached out to a friend, hoping he'd join me, but alas, he was engrossed in
home renovations. It seemed I'd be embarking on this expedition solo. Which is fine. Most my trips are.

My girlfriend, previously disinterested in camping and wary of the challenges
posed by a packed backpack and a lack of off-road tires on her bike, surprised
me by deciding to accompany me on this journey. Her willingness to join filled
me with joy. As we set out on our adventure, we encountered an
unexpected twist - an exorbitant pitstop at a gas station where we were charged
a staggering 175kr ($16.50 USD) for two chocolates and some coffee. Oh the twistness. No, but really. What.

## **Discovering Serenity by the Lake**

Our journey to Mykle was relatively uneventful, except for the highway robbery
at the gas station. However, our quest for the perfect camping spot led us to
an encounter with a local who knew the area like the back of her hand. She
graciously recommended a pristine location on a nearby beach. The site proved
to be a gem, offering multiple fire pits, breathtaking vistas, several fishing
spots, and, most importantly, solitude. We quickly set up camp, with me tending
to the fire and my girlfriend setting out on her exploration, indulging in
blueberries, scouting for mushrooms, and trying her luck with the fishing spots.

As the day drew to a close, I decided to prepare the canned stew I had brought
along since the fish didn't cooperate. We whiled away the evening playing cards by the flickering flames,
sipping on less-than-stellar whiskey, and eventually retiring to our hammocks
for the night.

## **A Chilly Awakening**

Little did we know, we had underestimated the biting cold that night. Even though I was sweating in my fancy sleeping
bag, my girlfriend endured hours of icy discomfort, her toes growing increasingly
frigid as she struggled to find warmth. Eventually, she mustered the courage to
wake me from my slumber. With reluctance, we packed up our camp and made the
decision to drive back home at 2 a.m. Although the situation was far from ideal
– I had experienced my fair share of bone-chilling nights – her unwavering
spirit and positive demeanor impressed me to no end. I felt a sense of pride
and admiration for her resilience. Driving through the night is a rarity for
me, so I embraced the opportunity without complaint.

In the end, what began as a quest for hammock dreams and off-road exploration
led us to a night of unexpected challenges and a chilly awakening. Yet, through
it all, we discovered the true warmth (heh) of shared experiences and the unbreakable
bond of adventure.

I got an urge to get out and sleep in my hammock. I get these every now and
then. I had one place not so far away that I wanted to visit, a lake called
[Mykle](https://goo.gl/maps/p3u6Kseg8ZGFKXKG8), hoping there would be some gravel roads to explore. Asked my friend if
he'd join, but he was busy working on the house. I thought I'd be going alone
since my girlfriend said on a previous trip that she didn't enjoy camping, nor
driving with a packed backpack, nor does she have off road tyres on her bike,
making gravel roads a bit hard for her. However, she surprised me and ended up
tagging along. I was very happy about that. The trip there was pretty
uneventful, except for getting robbed by a gas station. They demanded 175kr
($16.50 USD) for two chocolates and some coffee. While surveying for a place to
camp, a woman approached us who knew the area and recommended a spot for us on
a beach nearby. We checked it out and it was perfect. Had multiple fire pits, a
beautiful view, a couple of fishing spots and best of all - no one else was
there. We set up camp and I went ahead gathering firewood and setting up a
fire. She went out and about exploring the area, eating blue berries, gathering
mushrooms and fishing. She almost caught a fish, but it got away. It was
getting late, so I decided to cook up the canned stew I brought along. We
played cards next to the fire, drank some not so good whiskey and later went to
sleep.

We underestimated the temperature a bit, so after she had been laying there
trying to sleep while freezing her toes off for a few hours, she gave in and
woke me up. We ended up packing up and driving home at 2am. Even though it's a
pretty shitty situation to be in (I know, I've been freezing through a lot of
nights before), her attitude and mood was impeccable. I was both impressed and
proud. I was also happy to be able to drive during the night. I'm rarely able
to find time to be driving in the night due to the fact that I'm often sleeping
instead, so I wasn't very bothered.
