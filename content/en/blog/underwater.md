As the chill of autumn started to creep in, I convinced my friend Kim to embark
on a farewell ride to the season. Our rendezvous point was the local gas
station at 10:00 am on a crisp Sunday morning.

We charted our course, and with the hum of our engines beneath us, we set off.
The journey to our destination was a reminder that winter was knocking at the
door - the cold was penetrating. We decided to stop for a warm respite of
coffee and snacks at a gas station.

During this pit stop, we found ourselves tinkering with the DB killer on my new
slip-on exhaust. After a short struggle due to me previously stripping the
threads, Kim managed to remove it. The result was a throaty roar that echoed
off the surrounding landscape - a sound that brought a wide grin to my face.
Though I was a bit concerned about the noise level, the thrill of the ride took
over.

Our destination was a place I had previously [visited](/en/blog/winter-is-coming/) with my girlfriend for
camping, but the connecting roads remained a mystery. As we ventured further,
we stumbled upon an old power plant with a connected settlement. The sight was
eerily beautiful, a testament to a time gone by.

Our adventure took an unexpected turn when we discovered that due to
maintenance on a dam, the river had been drained. This gave us a unique
opportunity to test our bikes on the riverbed. We found ourselves gleefully
navigating through sand, mud, and rocks. It was like being kids again, playing
in a giant playground.

After capturing these unforgettable moments with pictures and taking our fill
of the riverbed, we decided to push further up the river. This led us to a
trail that took us to an abandoned farm - a serene and beautiful sight to end
our adventure.

As we rode back with the setting sun painting the sky with hues of orange and
red, we knew we had made the most of the season's last ride. Our spontaneous
journey turned out to be a memorable adventure, filled with unexpected
discoveries and the simple joy of exploration.

We've had a running competition on who could drop their bike the most times. Here
is Kim trying to cheat his way into a late victory. I was adamant about it not
counting unless he dropped it properly while trying to best an obstacle or tricky
road, but we later agreed that he'd get at least 0.25 drops for silly ones like this.
Due to this drop, and a similar one on a previous trip, I'll have to concede to him
taking the lead with 2.5 to 2. Well played Kim, well played. Next season I'm removing
my side stand.

Weathers getting cold fast, so I reached out to Kim (male) on saturday suggesting we go for a ride on sunday to say
our goodbyes to the season. He was up for it, and we decided to meet up at 10:00 at the local gas station. After
deciding on a route, we set off. Right before we got to the area we wanted to explore, we stopped at a gas station
for a warm coffee and a snack. The transportation leg turned out to demonstrate how close we were to the end of the
season - we got pretty cold. After a short break where I had been complaining about how I messed up the screw for the
DB killer on my new slip-on exhaust, Kim was curious to see both if he was able to remove it, and how it sounded. After
tinkering for less than a minute, it was off. God damn it sounded good. Still not convinced that the sound is
objectively silent enough to be driving around with without pissing off people, but I was smiling the whole remainder
of the trip.

Soon we got to the place we wanted to explore. I had been there before with my girlfriend camping, but I had not
explored the connecting roads. Man did I miss out. First we came across an old power plant with a connected settlement.
Further up the river, it turned out that they were doing maintenance on a dam which meant they had drained the river.
Jackpot. We were able to test our bikes on the riverbed, and it was a blast. It was pretty wet and very slippery. We
were driving around like kids in a playground. There was sand, mud, rocks and nifty mountains to climb.

After taking some pictures and playing around, we decided to move further up the river. We found a road that turned
into a trail, and followed it up to an abandoned farm. Serene and beautiful.
