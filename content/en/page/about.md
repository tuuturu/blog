## Introduction

Writing these introductions can be a bit awkward, but I'll give it a shot. Hi,
I'm Julius. I work as a software engineer in Oslo, Norway. My interests span
from programming and gaming to music, but the one that truly sets my heart
racing is motorcycling. Even though I've held my license for only a few years,
there's always been this inexplicable connection to motorcycles that I couldn't
ignore. Perhaps it's a piece of my dad's biker past echoing within me, or maybe
it's the promise of freedom and boundless adventure. Honestly, I'm not quite
sure.

## Where it all began

My journey started with a 2018 Yamaha MT-09 900cc. The 2018 model is equipped with traction
control, ABS, and driving modes â€“ features that allowed me to tailor the bike
to my growth as a rider. From day one, it felt like an extension of myself.
Despite the chilly climate, I've embraced every opportunity to ride,
accumulating a respectable 60,000 kilometers. While not designed for long
tours, it carried me across the Netherlands, England, and even through Denmark,
Sweden, and Germany. It's been a trusty companion.

## The T7

Though my friends and family suggested an adventure bike would suit me better,
my heart was devoted to my MT-09. Lately, I've noticed that maintaining the
same thrill on tarmac required a bit more throttle, pushing my limits in turns,
and an increasing urge for track days. However, a turning point arrived when I
stumbled upon Pol Tarres' YouTube videos. His [Seeker 1](https://youtu.be/eDxBGc9TD4c?feature=shared) and
[Seeker 2](https://youtu.be/7PngVqi5wT8?feature=shared) captivated me, sparking my
desire for a Tenere 700. The more adventure videos I watched, the clearer it
became: I had to own one. So, I traded a chance to sing November Rain in the
rain at a GnR concert for a Tenere 700. Though a shame, I
wouldn't change a thing.

The T7 has been a gateway to a fresh world of exploration. While I've always
cherished gravel riding with the MT-09, the T7 emboldens me to embrace a
playful spirit. Its crash cage provides a reassuring sense of durability,
allowing me to venture into the unknown. Yes, there have been tumbles.

Additionally, I've embarked on longer rides with the T7, and the experience is
remarkably different from my travels with the MT-09. This thing handles longer trips quite well.
