I initially looked for a Git client. Already have a text editor on my phone,
so to keep it simple I'd just hook up the
[Hugo repo](https://github.com/tuuturu/blog) and I'd be good to go. But then! I
found an app called [GitJournal](https://gitjournal.io/) which let me customize
it to work kind of perfect. 

This post is written from my phone. Hurray!
