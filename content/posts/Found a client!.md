I initially looked for a git client. Already have a text editor on my phone, so to keep it simple I'd just hook up the Hugo repo and I'd be good to go. But then! I found an app called [GitJournal](https://gitjournal.io/) which let me customize it to work kind of perfect. 

This post is written from my phone. Hurray!
