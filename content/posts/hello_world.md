For my first trip, I decided to take my bike and ride to Mount Hyjal. I know,
I know, its not a real place. However, it serves as a mock place for testing
out this new blogging solution.

I'm sure I could've chosen much better places, but really, could I?
I feel like if I'm to decide back and forth on it, It'll soon become tiresome.
