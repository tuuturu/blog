They say trolls used to roam this place.

It took me six hours to sneak past the old and grumpy troll guarding the entrance to this place. No matter, the price will be worth it. 

It pleases me to inform you that the sneaking was in vain. Not far from the goal, a fly attacked me and I bitch slapped that little shit so hard I'll be getting bruises on my thigh. Bruises aside, the sound that emanated through the valley was just enough to wake the rest of the trolls up. Being too deep in it by now, I started fighting my way through.

After the smoke had risen and the sounds of fighting slowly had died down, I sat down and were able to enjoy my prize.
