No matter, the price will be worth it.\nIt pleases me to inform you that the sneaking was in vain. Not far from the goal, a fly attacked me and I bitch slapped that little shit so hard I’ll be getting bruises on my thigh. Bruises aside, the sound that emanated through the valley was just enough to wake the rest of the trolls up. Being too deep in it by now, I started fighting my way through.\nAfter the smoke had risen and the sounds of fighting slowly had died down, I sat down and were able to enjoy my prize.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Lunch at Trollsvann","uri":"/posts/lunch-at-trollsvann/"},{"categories":["general"],"content":"I initially looked for a Git client. Already have a text editor on my phone, so to keep it simple I’d just hook up the Hugo repo and I’d be good to go. But then! I found an app called GitJournal which let me customize it to work kind of perfect.\nThis post is written from my phone. Hurray!\n","description":"","tags":["gohugo"],"title":"Found a client!","uri":"/posts/found-a-client/"},{"categories":["general"],"content":"\nHey! Finally found a half decent way of publishing some blog content. I’ve been testing out a few solutions, tried to build my own and momentum just kept disappearing.\nTook a while, but now I’ve decided to test out Hugo. With a little luck, I’ll find some neat tool which will allow me to post new posts to Github, and Github Actions + Hugo will take care of the rest.\nNot sure what I’ll use this blog for yet, other than motoblogging. We’ll see.\n","description":"","tags":["gohugo"],"title":"Welcome!","uri":"/posts/first-post/"}]
