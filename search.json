Finally found a half decent way of publishing some blog content. I’ve been testing out a few solutions, tried to build my own and momentum just kept disappearing.\nTook a while, but now I’ve decided to test out Hugo. With a little luck, I’ll find some neat tool which will allow me to post new posts to Github, and Github Actions + Hugo will take care of the rest.\nNot sure what I’ll use this blog for yet, other than motoblogging. We’ll see.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Welcome!","uri":"/blog/posts/first-post/"}]
