Here&amp;rsquo;s a glimpse of my journey through eight countries, each experienced from the perspective of my trusty MT09 and T7.

Our rendezvous point was the local gas station at 10:00 am on a crisp Sunday morning.
We charted our course, and with the hum of our engines beneath us, we set off. The journey to our destination was a reminder that winter was knocking at the door - the cold was penetrating.</description></item><item><title>The Old Road to Vivestad</title><link>https://blog.tuuturu.io/en/blog/old-roads/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.tuuturu.io/en/blog/old-roads/</guid><description>Have you ever had a friend who could turn any ordinary day into an extraordinary adventure? Well, I have a friend like that - Kim. One day, out of the blue, he sent me a text message that would set the wheels in motion for a memorable motorcycle trip. The conversation went something like this:
Kim: &amp;ldquo;hello?&amp;rdquo;

These cravings for outdoor solitude strike every now and then, and this time, I had a particular place in mind: a serene lake known as Mykle .

Setting Off on a Rainy Day My friend Kim and I embarked on a ride with a mission: to master the art of identifying gravel and off-road paths, embrace the thrill of these terrains, and dive headfirst into our newfound hobby.
